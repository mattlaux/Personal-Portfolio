This is the second part of a two-part series. If you have not read <Link href='/posts/settingUpNextAuth'><a>Part I</a></Link>, I recommend giving it a look.

## Overview

In the first guide we created a Next.js application with NextAuth.js implemented for authentication and authorization. 

This guide builds upon that to add an online payments system through Stripe.

For the backend we will use a postgreSQL database with Prisma as the ORM.

For authentication and authorization we will use NextAuth.js with the Auth0 provider.

For the online payments system we will use Stripe.

If you would like to view or copy the completed code for these two guides you can find it 
<Link href='https://github.com/mattlaux/NextAuth.js_And_Stripe_Next.js_Example'><a>here on Github</a></Link>.

### Example signup and payment flow

Below I detail the signup and payment flow for our example web application.

1. User signups through NextAuth.js Auth0 provider
2. New user is created in locally hosted database
3. New customer is created in Stripe's hosted services
4. User upgrades subscription status to pro
5. User record in locally hosted database is updated to pro
6. Stripe customer record is updated to pro with billing and subscription information
<div id='stripe' />

## Set up Stripe

If you are accepting online payments Stripe is one of your best options. It abstracts away much of the logic while allowing
sufficient customization to create the specific solution that you need.

Through Stripe you can allow online payments, subscriptions, billing information management, and much more with minimal code.

Stripe is absolutely packed with features; however, in this guide we will simply use it to allow users to signup for a paid subscription.

### Create Stripe account

Before we can integrate Stripe with our Next.js application, we need to <Link href='https://stripe.com'><a>create a Stripe account.</a></Link>

While setting up Stripe accounts, Stripe may ask you to enter specific information about your business. At this point in time,
you most likely do not have this information. That is fine. You can skip this for now. 

Until you verify your business, you will have a test account and will not be able to accept real payments. For our purposes this is sufficient.

After creating your account as well as an account for your business, navigate to the homepage of your business account.

On the homepage you will see an area titled *For developers*. This area contains the *Publishable key* and *Secret key* values 
we need to add to our *.env.local* file:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
...

# STRIPE

NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxxxx  
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxx
```

</div>

<p id='stripeWithNextAuth'>The STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET we will not have quite yet. This will come once we set up the Stripe webhook. You can leave this value blank for now.</p>

## Integrate Stripe with NextAuth.js

First we need to install the Stripe package:

<div className={styles.code}>
  ```
  npm install stripe
  ```
</div>

After installing the Stripe package, we need to add a Stripe event to the *[...nextauth].ts* file. NextAuth.js has a 
<Link href='https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/events'><a>handful of events</a></Link> that can be handled.

We will be using the *createUser* event to ensure that a Stripe customer is created.

Below I have detailed how our createUser event will work:

1. Create a Stripe API client instance
2. Create a Stripe customer on Stripe's servers
3. Update the user table in the local database with the Stripe customer ID

<div className={styles.code}>

```

...
import Stripe from 'stripe';

export default NextAuth({
  adapter: ...,
  providers: ...,
  callbacks: ...,
  events: {
    // Creates a Stripe customer and populates database on signup
    createUser: async ({ user }) => {
      // Create stripe API client using the secret key env variable
      const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, {
        apiVersion: '2020-08-27',
      });

      // Create a stripe customer for the user with their email address
      await stripe.customers
        .create({
          email: user.email!,
        })
        .then(async (customer) => {
          // Use the Prisma Client to update the user in the database with their new Stripe customer ID   
          return prisma.user.update({
            where: { id: user.id },
            data: {
              stripeCustomerId: customer.id,
            },
          });
        });
    },
  },
});

```

</div>

Now that we have the createUser event added we can test that a Stripe customer is added when a new user is added to our
database.

If you have previously logged-in to your web application then delete the row from the *User* table.

Now log in to your web application as you did previously and then check your Stripe dashboard. At the top is a header called *Customers*.

<p id='onlinePayments'>There should be a new customer added that matches your user information. In addition, if you check your postgreSQL database
you should see that the *stripeCustomerId* field is now populated and matches the customer id from the Stripe dashboard.</p>

## Add online payments

One of the great benefits of Stripe is that we have access to a checkout page hosted by Stripe. This handles all of the financial
data and security so that we do not have to.

The downside of this method is that we have to use a webhook to communicate with Stripe. Webhooks can be a little complicated but
they are significantly easier than attempting to code our own payment system.

### Create Stripe webhook

The Stripe webhook offers a secure way for us to handle different events from the Stripe API. 

For example, when one of our customers signs up for a monthly subscription we can have custom code that then updates their
status in our postgreSQL database.

Stripe events are extremely powerful and can allow you to accomplish many different functionalities with your web application.

Before we create our Stripe webhook there are a couple of packages we need to install:

<div className={styles.code}>
  ```
  npm install micro micro-cors
  ```
</div>
<div className={styles.code}>
  ```
  npm install --save-dev @types/micro @types/micro-cors
  ```
</div>

If you have any experience with web security, you may be wondering why we need to enable CORS. By default all Next.js API routes
are same-origin only. The micro-cors package allows our webhook to communicate with our API paths.

In the *pages/api* folder create a folder called *stripe*. In this folder add a file called *webhooks.ts* with the following code:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
import { buffer } from "micro";
import Cors from "micro-cors";
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import Stripe from "stripe";
import prisma from "../../../prisma/sharedClient";

// https://vercel.com/guides/getting-started-with-nextjs-typescript-stripe

// Load Stripe package for Node environment
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, {
  apiVersion: "2020-08-27",
});

const webhookSecret: string = process.env.STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET!;

// Stripe requires the raw body to construct the event.
export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false,
  },
};

const cors = Cors({
  allowMethods: ["POST", "HEAD"],
});

const webhookHandler = async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  if (req.method === "POST") {
    const buf = await buffer(req);
    const sig = req.headers["stripe-signature"]!;

    let event: Stripe.Event;

    try {
      event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
        buf.toString(),
        sig,
        webhookSecret
      );
    } catch (err) {
      const errorMessage = err instanceof Error ? err.message : "Unknown error";
      // On error, log and return the error message.
      if (err! instanceof Error) console.log(err);
      console.log(`‚ùå Error message: ${errorMessage}`);
      res.status(400).send("Webhook Error");
      return;
    }

    // Successfully constructed event.
    console.log("‚úÖ Success:", event.id);

    // Cast event data to Stripe object.
    if (event.type === "payment_intent.succeeded") {
      const paymentIntent = event.data.object as Stripe.PaymentIntent;
      console.log(`üí∞ PaymentIntent status: ${paymentIntent.status}`);
    } else if (event.type === "payment_intent.payment_failed") {
      const paymentIntent = event.data.object as Stripe.PaymentIntent;
      console.log(
        `‚ùå Payment failed: ${paymentIntent.last_payment_error?.message}`
      );
    } else if (event.type === "charge.succeeded") {
      const charge = event.data.object as Stripe.Charge;
      console.log(`üíµ Charge id: ${charge.id}`);
    } else if (event.type === "customer.subscription.created") {
      const subscription = event.data.object as Stripe.Subscription;
      console.log(subscription.customer);
      await prisma.user.update({
        // Find the customer in our database with the Stripe customer ID linked to this purchase   
        where: {
          stripeCustomerId: subscription.customer as string,
        },
        // Update that customer so their status is now active
        data: {
          isPro: true,
        },
      });
    } else {
      console.warn(`ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Unhandled event type: ${event.type}`);
    }
    // Return a response to acknowledge receipt of the event.
    res.json({ received: true });
  } else {
    res.setHeader("Allow", "POST");
    res.status(405).end("Method Not Allowed");
  }
};

export default cors(webhookHandler as any);
```

</div>

There is a lot of code here. We are interested in the section with the comment *// Cast event data to Stripe object*.

Stripe has many different events that can be included in this file.

In our case we are focused on the following event:

- customer.subscription.created

In these events you will notice a line of code *prisma.user.update*. This line of code allows
CRUD operations to be completed by Prisma.

This is much more simple than writing your own SQL to query the database anytime you want to adjust a record. Additional 
information about conducting CRUD operations through Prisma can be found in the <Link href='https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/crud#update-a-single-record'><a>Prisma documentation</a></Link>.

The following events have also been included as additional examples but have no functionality other than logging to the console:

- payment_intent.succeeded
- payment_intent.payment_failed
- charge.succeeded

A list of all Stripe events can be found in this <Link href='https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types'><a>Stripe documentation</a></Link>.

If you are interested in learning about the other code included in this webhooks file, the following <Link href='https://vercel.com/guides/getting-started-with-nextjs-typescript-stripe'><a>guide</a></Link>
includes additional information.

#### customer.subscription.created

This event will occur when a new user signs up for a paid subscription which we will add shortly. The customer's Stripe id will
be retrieved from the Stripe event object. This id number will be matched with the *stripeCustomerId* field from our postgreSQL database
and the *isPro* field will be updated to true. 

Our system can now differentiate non-paying and paying customers.

### Install Stripe CLI 

We will use the Stripe CLI to communicate with the Stripe API and host the webhook.

Follow <Link href='https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli'><a>this guide</a></Link> to install and set up the Stripe CLI.

Now we need to start our webhook so that it can listen for Stripe events. Open a new terminal and enter the following line:

<div className={styles.code}>
  ```
  stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/stripe/webhooks
  ```
</div>

Ensure that the URL path matches your specific folder structure.

If your webhook successfully starts you will see the following message in your terminal:

<div className={styles.code}>
  ```
  Ready! You are using Stripe API Version [2020-08-27]. Your webhook signing secret is whsec_xxxxxxxxx (^C to quit)
  ```
</div>

The signing secret will be *whsec_* followed by a very long string. You need to copy this entire string and add it to your
*.env.local* file for the empty STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET variable.

### Create Stripe subscription plan

Before our customers can sign up for a paid subscription, we need to create the subscription plan in our Stripe account.

On your business' Stripe dashboard there should be a header called *products*. Click *Add a product* and give the product a 
name. Leave the Pricing model on *Standard pricing*, set a price of *$10.00* that recurs monthly. Then click *Save product*.

You should now see a summary page of your product details. Under the *Pricing* section should be an *API ID* header with a 
value that looks like *price_j3Kadoe8Ejdn*.

In your *.env.local* file add the following variable:

<div className={styles.code}>
  ```
  STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION=price_j3Kadoe8Ejdn
  ```
</div>

Be sure to replace the *price_* string with your applicable string.

### Create Stripe checkout session

As mentioned earlier, one of the benefits of using Stripe is that we do not need to create our own checkout page. Instead, we
will create an API path that opens a Stripe-hosted checkout session for our users.

First we will create a file called *stripe.config.ts* in your root folder with the following code:

<div className={styles.code}>
  ```
  export const AMOUNT = 10.0
  ```
</div>

This value is the dollar amount for your subscription plan. It is best practice to declare this variable in one location and then
import it where needed. As your web application grows, you can use this variable to display the price on landing pages, submit the price to Stripe checkout pages,
etc.

If you need to change it you only need to change it in one location. In addition, as your business grows you will more than likely
end up with multiple products. The *stripe.config.ts* files helps to keep these products and their prices organized.

Next we will add a button to our dashboard page:

<div className={styles.code}>
```
{session?.user.isPro ? (
  <h2>You have a pro subscription</h2>
) : (
  <h2>You do not have a pro subscription</h2>
)}
<button onClick={() => handleCheckout()}>Upgrade to Pro Subscription</button>
```
</div>

Now we will create the *handleCheckout* function. In your root folder create a folder called *library* with file a called
*handleCheckout.ts* with the following code:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
import { fetchPostJSON } from './fetchJSON';
import { AMOUNT } from '../stripe.config';
import getStripe from './getStripe';

export const handleCheckout = async () => {
  // Create a Checkout Session.
  const response = await fetchPostJSON(
    '/api/stripe/checkoutSession',
    {
      amount: AMOUNT,
    }
  );
  if (response.statusCode === 500) {
    console.error(response.message);
  }
  // Redirect to Checkout.
  const stripe = await getStripe();
  const { error } = await stripe!.redirectToCheckout({   
    sessionId: response.id,
  });
  console.warn(error.message);
};
```

</div>

Be sure to import this function to your *dashboard* page.

There are a few helper functions and API paths we need to add in order to complete the Stripe checkout session process.

#### Create fetchPostJSON function

In your *library* folder add a file called *fetchPostJSON* with the following code:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
/**
 * Handles POST requests for Stripe
 * @param url
 * @param data Optional data. Transaction amount when used with Stripe
 * @returns JSON response from API or error
 */
export async function fetchPostJSON(
  url: string,
  data?: Record<string, unknown>
) {
  try {
    // Default options are marked with *
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: "POST", // *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
      mode: "cors", // no-cors, *cors, same-origin
      cache: "no-cache", // *default, no-cache, reload, force-cache, only-if-cached
      credentials: "same-origin", // include, *same-origin, omit
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
      },
      redirect: "follow", // manual, *follow, error
      referrerPolicy: "no-referrer", // no-referrer, *client
      body: JSON.stringify(data || {}), // body data type must match "Content-Type" header   
    });
    return await response.json(); // parses JSON response into native JavaScript objects
  } catch (err) {
    if (err instanceof Error) {
      throw new Error(err.message);
    }
    throw err;
  }
}
```

</div>

This fetch function includes all of the necessary settings in order to open a Stripe checkout page.

#### Create getStripe function

Install the following package:

<div className={styles.code}>
  ```
  npm install @stripe/stripe-js
  ```
</div>

In your *library* folder create a function called *getStripe* with the following code:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
import { Stripe, loadStripe } from "@stripe/stripe-js";

// This is a singleton to ensure we only instantiate Stripe once on the frontend   
let stripePromise: Promise<Stripe | null>;
const getStripe = () => {
  if (!stripePromise) {
    stripePromise = loadStripe(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY!);
  }
  return stripePromise;
};

export default getStripe;
```

</div>

This function ensures that we only load Stripe once on the frontend. Loading Stripe multiple times on the frontend can cause issues.

There should now be no errors on your *handleCheckout.ts* file.

#### Create checkoutSession API path

The final step in enabling a Stripe checkout session is the API path. Under your *pages/api/stripe* folder create a file called
*checkoutSession.ts* with the following code:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { AMOUNT } from "../../../stripe.config";
import Stripe from "stripe";
import { getSession } from "next-auth/react";

const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!, {
  apiVersion: "2020-08-27",
});

/**
 * Next API path to connect with Stripe API
 * @param req
 * @param res
 */
export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse
) {
  const session = await getSession({ req });

  if (session) {
    if (req.method === "POST") {
      const amount: number = req.body.amount;
      try {
        let subscriptionType;
        // Validate the amount that was passed from the client.
        if (amount !== AMOUNT) throw new Error();
        // Create Checkout Sessions from body params.
        const params: Stripe.Checkout.SessionCreateParams = {
          mode: "subscription",
          customer: session.user.stripeCustomerId,
          payment_method_types: ["card"],
          line_items: [
            {
              price: process.env.STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION, // Product API Key from Stripe
              quantity: 1,
            },
          ],
          success_url: `${req.headers.origin}/result?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`,   
          cancel_url: `${req.headers.origin}/dashboard`,
          subscription_data: {
            metadata: {
              // Adds note on Stripe so we can manually check if a user is Pro member
              payingUserId: session.user.id,
            },
          },
        };
        const checkoutSession: Stripe.Checkout.Session =
          await stripe.checkout.sessions.create(params);
        res.status(200).json(checkoutSession);
      } catch (err) {
        const errorMessage =
          err instanceof Error ? err.message : "Internal server error";
        res.status(500).json({ statusCode: 500, message: errorMessage });
      }
    } else {
      res.setHeader("Allow", "POST");
      res.status(405).end("Method Not Allowed");
    }
  } else {
    res
      .status(401)
      .send("You must be signed-in to view the protected content on this page");
  }
}

```

</div>

This API path is what actually communicates with the Stripe API to open a checkout page. This file has a lot going on and I 
am not going to discuss all of it.

<p id='testPayments'>If you are interested in learning more about how the Stripe checkout session process works check out 
<Link href='https://stripe.com/docs/api/checkout/sessions/create?lang=node'><a>this Stripe documentation</a></Link>.</p>

## Test Stripe online payments

Start your development server, log in, and notice that your dashboard reads *You do not have a pro subscription*. Click the 
*Upgrade to Pro Subscription* button. After a second or two, you should see a Stripe checkout page similar to the one below 
appear.

<figure>
  <Image
    src="/images/posts/settingUpStripe/stripeCheckoutPage.webp"
    className="rounded"
    height={864}
    width={1218}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>Blank Stripe checkout page</figcaption>
</figure>

Stripe offers a number of different test cards for different situations. In our case we will be using *4242 4242 4242 4242*
to test our application.

This card will allow you to test your Stripe flow without having to enter any real billing information.

The *MM/YY* field can be any future date, the *CVC* field can be any three numbers, the *name* field can be any combination of 
letters and numbers, and the *zip* field can be any string of numbers.

After submitting your mock payment information, you should be redirected to your dashboard. There are three checks you should
perform to ensure the process worked:

1. Your dashboard should now say *You have a pro subscription*
2. If you click on your customer on the Stripe dashboard it should show an active subscription
3. The isPro field on your postgreSQL database should read true
<div id='nextSteps' />

## Next steps

This concludes the two-part series for integrating NextAuth.js and Stripe with a Next.js web application. You now have the
knowledge and reference materials to provide your web application with authentication and authorization through Next.js.

In addition, you are able to integrate NextAuth.js with Stripe to accept and manage online payments.

These are both essential features to an full-stack web application.

I encourage you to expand upon this example. Refer to the Stripe and NextAuth.js documentation to discover all the different
features that they offer. Some recommendations for next steps follow:

- Add a pro subscription check on dashboard to restrict user's from signing up for duplicate subscriptions
- Allow a user to cancel their subscription
- Add multiple Stripe subscription plans (yearly vs monthly)
- Allow a user to delete their billing information from Stripe's servers
- Allow a user to change their billing information from Stripe's servers
- Allow a user to fully delete their profile from Stripe and the local database
