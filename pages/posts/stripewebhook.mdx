## **Don't make the common mistake**

Many traders started trading during the absolute insanity of 2020 and 2021. Covid hit and the markets tanked. And then the
markets slingshot back. And then the meme-stocks took over.

During all of this, people were desperate to take advantage of the crazy volatility. Many people's equity curve most likely
looked like the below image.

So what was their mistake?

Not learning how to trade before the trading opportunities appeared. Many people look back at 2020 and 2021 and cringe when they
see how much money they could have made.

Learn how to trade now so that you are prepared for the next opportunity. It does not matter how much or how little trading
capital you have. You need to start learning today.

## **How much can you expect to earn?**

The honest answer is it depends how much trading capital you have.

Check out the three theoretical trades below:

### **Trader #1**

- Available trading capital: $5,000
- Average yearly return: 20%
- Yearly profit: $1,000

### **Trader #2**

- Available trading capital: $100,000
- Average yearly return: 20%
- Yearly profit: $20,000

### **Trader #3**

- Available trading capital: $1,000,000
- Average yearly return: 20%
- Yearly profit: $200,000

All of these trader's achieved a return of 20%, but trader #3 clearly made much more than trader #1. In fact, trader #1 would not
even be able to pay rent with his yearly profit.

So what results in this large difference in profit? The answer is trading capital.

_It takes money to make money_

If you want to make significant money trading, you are going to need significant money to trade with.

However, if you do not have much trading capital now that is fine. You can start training now and begin building up your
trading capital.

## **The three factors in income potential**

1. Trading capital
2. Annual return
3. Annual account growth

### **Trading capital**

Trading capital is by far the most impactful of these factors.

10% of $10,000 and 1% of $200,000 both equate to a profit a $2,000. But 1% is significantly easier to achieve than 10%.

### **Annual return**

Annual return is how much your strategy historically returns and how much you anticipate it to return in the future.

If you strategy is making less than 10% annually you are probably better off just puttin it in an index fund that tracks
the market.

However, if your strategy can consistently return 20% (a good, realistic return) then your strategy is worth running.

### **Annual account growth**

Annual account growth is how much of your profit you leave in your account after withdrawing for expenses. Many people do not
consider this but you should leave some profit in your account.

## **So how do you trade if you do not have much capital?**

First off nearly all brokers offer paper trading accounts. These are accounts that reflect real market conditions and allow
you to place trades as if you were actually trading.

**Regardless of your trading capital you need to start with paper trading accounts.**

Through these accounts you will establish good trading habits. Even veteran traders use paper trading to test out new
strategies.

Paper trading is one of the most valuable tools in a trader's arsenal.

In addition to paper trading accounts, there are proprietary trading firms. Proprietary trading firms (more commonly known
as prop firms) allow you to trade with the firm's money in exchange for a cut of the profits.

Typically prop firms will have an evaluation phase. If you meet their qualifications then they will provide capital for you
to trade with.

If you a skilled trader, this is a fantastic way for you to make significant amounts of money without having to spend years
building up your trading capital.

Many traders with low trading capital will start with prop firms until they have built up their own trading capital. Just be
sure to do your research as there are many scams and unethical prop firms out there.
