As part of my learning process, I have been developing a Saas tool called <Link href='https://retailalgotrader.com'><a>RetailAlgoTrader.</a></Link>

A primary goal of mine is to understand how to develop a full-stack, production-ready web application. As a result, it is necessary
to implement an authentication and authorization flow as well as on online payments system.

## Overview

In this guide we will walk through step-by-step how to create a Next.js web application with authentication as well as
online payments.

For the backend we will use a postgreSQL database with Prisma as the ORM.

For authentication and authorization we will use NextAuth.js with the Auth0 provider.

For the online payments system we will use Stripe.

5. <a href='#test'>Test NextAuth.js flow</a>

### Example signup and payment flow

Below I detail the signup and payment flow for our example web application.

1. User signups through NextAuth.js Auth0 provider
2. New user is created in locally hosted database
3. New customer is created in Stripe's hosted services
4. User upgrades subscription status to pro
5. User record in locally hosted database is updated to pro
6. Stripe customer record is updated to pro with billing and subscription information
7. User cancels subscription
8. User record in locally hosted database is updated to non-pro
9. Stripe customer record is updated to non-paying customer

## Create initial Next.js project

For this example we will be using Typescript and npm. If you are interested in discovering the advantages of Typescript over Javascript
check out <Link href='/posts/typescriptVsJavascript'><a>this article</a></Link>.

Next.js makes it very easy to create a Typescript Next.js project with npm:

<div className={styles.code}>npx create-next-app@latest --typescript</div>

A prompt stating you need to install create-next-app may appear. This is okay to proceed with.

Continue through the prompts entering all of the necessary information. Allow npm to install the necessary dependencies. This
process can take a while.

## Establish .env file for API keys

It is extremely important to keep all API keys out of version control. Uploading API keys to version control is a serious security
flaw as it can allow other people to use your personal API keys. Node uses environment variables to safely manage API keys.

In your root folder add a file titled _.env_. Leave this file blank for now.

If you check the _.gitignore_ file that was created for you, you will see that the .env file is already included. This ensures
that your .env file will not be uploaded to version control.
<div id='prisma'></div>

## Set up Prisma with PostgreSQL database

For our authentication flow we will be using NextAuth.js. NextAuth.js requires an adapter in order to connect to a database. We will
be using <Link href="https://www.prisma.io/"><a>Prisma</a></Link> for our adapter.

Prisma is a leading ORM for Typescript and SQL. ORMs simplify the manipulation and management of databases as opposed to
vanilla SQL.

If you are unfamiliar with Prisma that is fine. We will be using very basic features and Prisma is very easy to get started with.

### Establishing PostgreSQL database

For our database we will be using <Link href="https://www.postgresql.org/"><a>PostgreSQL.</a></Link> PostgreSQL is a one of the most popular and dependend SQL based databases.

You can download PostgreSQL at the following <Link href='https://www.postgresql.org/download/'><a>link.</a></Link>

In order to simplify the management of our PostgreSQL database we will be using <Link href="https://www.electronjs.org/apps/postbird"><a>Postbird.</a></Link>

Postbird is a GUI client that runs with Electron. If you are unfamiliar with SQL Postbird will assist you greatly.

Configuring a PostgreSQL database and connecting Postbird to a PostgreSQL database is outside of the scope of this guide.

If you need assistance in setting up these two programs this <Link href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/installing-and-using-postgresql-locally"><a>article</a></Link> from Codecademy details the process nicely.

### Populating .env file

Now that your PostgreSQL database is up and running we need to add the necessary variables to the .env file.

Before you can do this you will need to ensure your postgreSQL database has a user with sufficient permissions as well as a password.

When you initially install postgreSQL, a superUser is typically created. However, a password is usually not created. If your user
does not have a password you need to add one:

<div className={styles.code}>
  <p>
    ALTER USER <em>name</em> SET PASSWORD <em>'password'</em>
  </p>
</div>

To start we will add the necessary variables to allow your Next.js application access to your database. If you are hosting your
database locally then you will most likely use the below values for PGHOST and PGPORT.

PGUSER, PGDATABASE, and PGPASSWORD will be specific to you.

<div className={styles.code}>

```
# DB

PGHOST='localhost'
PGUSER='user_name'
PGDATABASE='database_name'
PGPASSWORD='user_password'
PGPORT=5432
```

</div>

Next we will add the necessary variables for Prisma:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
# PRISMA

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user_name:user_password@localhost:5432/database_name
```

</div>

Replace _user_name, user_password, and database_name_ with your specific information.

This variable will be used in your _prisma.schema_ file.

### Connect to PostgreSQL database

In your root folder create a file called config.ts with the below code:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
interface DB {
  PGHOST: string | undefined;
  PGUSER: string | undefined;
  PGDATABASE: string | undefined;
  PGPASSWORD: string | undefined;
  PGPORT: number | undefined;
}

// .env returns string but ClientConfig.port from pg package requires number
// Below code segment changes PGPORT from string to number
let pgPort = undefined;
if (process.env.PGPORT) {
  pgPort = parseInt(process.env.PGPORT);
}

const DB: DB = {
  PGHOST: process.env.PGHOST,
  PGUSER: process.env.PGUSER,
  PGDATABASE: process.env.PGDATABASE,
  PGPASSWORD: process.env.PGPASSWORD,
  PGPORT: pgPort,
};
const SESSION_SECRET = process.env.SESSION_SECRET;
const STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY;

export { DB, SESSION_SECRET, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY };
```

</div>

This file retrieves the database and Stripe enviromental variables and exports them for use in other files.

Next we will install the _pg_ package. This package supports connecting PostgreSQL databases and node applications.

<div className={styles.code}>npm install pg npm i --save-dev @types/pg</div>

Create a folder in the root folder called _db_. In the _db_ folder create a file called _index.ts_ with the below info:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
import { Pool } from 'pg';
import { DB } from '../config';

// Creates new pool instance for Postgres from .env
// Import this pool into all API routes that require a pool connection
const pool = new Pool({
  user: DB.PGUSER,
  host: DB.PGHOST,
  database: DB.PGDATABASE,
  password: DB.PGPASSWORD,
  port: DB.PGPORT,
});

export default pool;
```

</div>

The above code uses the _pg_ package to create a pool connection. This pool connection will handle all requests to and from
your PostgresSQL database.

### Installing and Configuring Prisma

The following code will install Prisma for your use:

<div className={styles.code}>npm install prisma --save-dev</div>
Next create a _Prisma_ folder in your root folder. Then create a file called _schema.prisma_
in the Prisma folder with the below content:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model Account {
  id                String @id @default(cuid())
  userId            String
  type              String
  provider          String
  providerAccountId String
  refresh_token     String? @db.Text
  access_token      String? @db.Text
  expires_at        Int?
  token_type        String?
  scope             String?
  id_token          String? @db.Text
  session_state     String?

  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)

  @@unique([provider, providerAccountId])
}

model Session {
  id           String @id @default(cuid())
  sessionToken String @unique
  userId       String
  expires      DateTime
  user User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
}

model User {
  id               String @id @default(cuid())
  name             String?
  email            String? @unique
  emailVerified    DateTime?
  image            String?
  accounts         Account[]
  sessions         Session[]
  stripeCustomerId String? @unique
  isPro             Boolean @default(false)
}

model VerificationToken {
  identifier   String
  token String @unique
  expires      DateTime

  @@unique([identifier, token])
}

```
</div>

This schema includes all of the necessary models and fields for NextAuth.js and Stripe and can be found at <Link href='https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/prisma'><a>Next.js' Prisma documentation.</a></Link>

The stripeCustomerId and isPro fields have been added to the User table in order to support Stripe.

Now we need to perform a Prisma migration to populate your database with the correct tables and fields.

<div className={styles.code}>npx prisma migrate dev</div>

Enter a name for the migration such as _initial_migration_.

Allow the process to complete and then check your database. It should now be populated with the tables and fields
specified in your _schema.prisma_ file.

Primsa used the schema from _prisma.schema_ and the credentials from .env to run a series of SQL commands to populate the database.

This process will also automatically create a migrations folder in your prisma folder.

If you run into any issues with the migration be sure to check the syntax of your _schema.prisma_ file. It can be easy to make a mistake.

Also check that your database is up and running through the Postgres and Postbird applications.

Finally, ensure that the credentials you have entered into your _.env_ file are correct.

Setting up and connecting to a database can be a tricky process. If have spent hours troubleshooting and are still running into
issues feel free to shoot me an email.

### Instantiating a Prisma client

A Prisma client is what you will use to interact with your PostgreSQL database. It is important that you only create a single
Prisma client that you then import when needed.

Next.js includes a very useful feautre called Fast Refresh. Unfortunately, this feature will repeatedly open new Prisma clients
without closing the previous.

This is not an issue in production, but in development in can cause issues and warnings. As a result, there is some code included
in the *sharedClient.ts* file to create a global Prisma client when in development.

NOTE: You want to ensure that the global Prisma client is only created when in a development environment.

If you would like to learn more about this issue you can read about it in the two links included in the below code.

In your prisma folder create a file called _sharedClient.ts_ with the following content:

<div className={styles.code}>
  
```
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import type { PrismaClient as PrismaClientType } from "@prisma/client";

let prisma: PrismaClientType;

// Nextjs Fast Refresh causes many instances of the Prisma client to open during development
// The below code restricts one Prisma client for development and one for production
// https://www.prisma.io/docs/support/help-articles/nextjs-prisma-client-dev-practices
// https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/6219

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "production") {
  prisma = new PrismaClient();
} else {
  if (!global.prisma) {
    global.prisma = new PrismaClient();
  }
  prisma = global.prisma;
}

export default prisma;
```

</div>

Now you are probably receiving the Typescript error: 

*Element implicitly has an 'any' type because type 'typeof globalThis' has no index signature.*

The cause of this error is not immediately evident and it has caused many developers hours of frustration. Since, Prisma was
designed with a global Prisma client in mind it does not have built-in Typescript support for it.

As a result we need to add our own custom Typescript support. In your root folder create a folder called *types*.

In this folder create a file called *prisma.d.tx* with the following content:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
import type { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

declare global {
  // supports global prisma client for use in development in sharedClient file
  // let and const cause errors to be thrown in the Prisma sharedClient file
  // https://www.prisma.io/docs/support/help-articles/nextjs-prisma-client-dev-practices
  // eslint-disable-next-line no-var
  var prisma: PrismaClient;
}
```

</div>

After saving this file, the Typescript error should disappear. Until Prisma releases an official fix for this issue we will
need to use this code as a workaround.

Your database should now be ready to integrate with NextAuth.js.
<div id='nextauth'></div>

## Set up NextAuth.js

NextAuth.js is one of the best options for setting up authentication and authorization with Next.js. It is the recommended option
from Next.js' documentation.

With NextAuth.js you can use a variety of OAuth providers such as Google or Facebook. In addition, you can use a standard email
and password login flow.

NextAuth.js can use sessions through a database or it can use JSON web tokens for authentication if you do not have a backend.

In our case we will be using sessions supported by a postgreSQL database.

The <Link href='https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/introduction'><a>NextAuth.js documentation</a></Link> is very detailed and is a great resource to keep bookmarked.

Before we get started implementing NextAuth, we need to install the *next-auth* and the *next-auth/prisma-adapter* packages:

<div className={styles.code}>npm install next-auth @next-auth/prisma-adapter</div>

### Create the [...nextauth].ts file

The first step to implementing NextAuth.js is setting up the *[...nextauth]* file.

This file acts as the dynamic route handler for NextAuth.js and contains all of the global NextAuth.js configurations.

Under the *pages/api* folder delete the file: *hello.ts*. Next create a folder called *auth* and inside add a file called
*[...nextauth].ts* with the following content:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import Auth0Provider from 'next-auth/providers/auth0';
import { PrismaAdapter } from '@next-auth/prisma-adapter';
import prisma from '../../../prisma/sharedClient';

// https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/example
export default NextAuth({
  adapter: PrismaAdapter(prisma),
  providers: [
    Auth0Provider({
      clientId: process.env.AUTH0_ID || '',
      clientSecret: process.env.AUTH0_SECRET || '',
      issuer: process.env.AUTH0_ISSUER,
    }),
  ],
  callbacks: {
    // Adds userId, stripeCustomerId, and isPro boolean from DB to the default session values
    session: async ({ session, user }) => {
      if (typeof user.id === 'string') session.user.id = user.id;
      if (typeof user.stripeCustomerId === 'string') {
        session.user.stripeCustomerId = user.stripeCustomerId;
      }
      if (typeof user.isPro === 'boolean') session.user.isPro = user.isPro;
      return Promise.resolve(session);
    },
  },
})
```

</div>

The Auth0Provider will not work until we create an <Link href='https://auth0.com/Auth0'><a>auth0 account.</a></Link>

After you have completed the sign-up process, click *Applications* and *Create New Application*. After you create your
new application you can view its' settings. These values will need to be added to your .env file.

The *Client ID* setting will be AUTH0_ID. The *Client Secret* setting will be AUTH0_SECRET. The *Domain* setting will be
AUTH0_ISSUER.

The NEXTAUTH_URL variable is simply the url that your site is hosted at.

The NEXTAUTH_SECRET variable is a random string that NextAuth.js uses to encrypt various features.

Paste the following code into your terminal to provide you with a sufficient string:

<div className={styles.code}>openssl rand -base64 32</div>

Your new .env file should look like the example below:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
# DB

PGHOST='localhost'
PGUSER='user_name'
PGDATABASE='database_name'
PGPASSWORD='user_password'
PGPORT=5432

# PRISMA

DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user_name:user_password@localhost:5432/database_name

# NEXT-AUTH

NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generated_secret_string
AUTH0_ID=auth0_client_id
AUTH0_SECRET=auth0_client_secret
AUTH0_ISSUER=https://auth0_domain
```

</div>

In addition, you need to add an allowed callback url and an allowed logout url to your Auth0 application. This can be seen if you scroll down on the
settings page.

In our example our allowed callback URL will be *http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/auth0* and our allowed logout url
will be *http://localhost:3000/*.

    src="/images/posts/settingUpNextAuth/auth0Urls.png"
    height={764}
    width={974}
    alt=""
  />
  <figcaption>Auth0 Urls</figcaption>
</figure>

If you use a provider other than Auth0 the process will look slightly different. Github is another great option and is very
simple to set up.

#### Add callback to [...nextauth.js]

While we are working on the *[...nextauth.js]* file, we will want to add a <Link href='https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/callbacks'><a>session callback.</a></Link>

A callback will run anytime the specified event occurs. In our case we want our callback to run when a new session is created.

Our callback will add the user.id, the user.stripeCustomerId, and the user.isPro fields from our database to our session object. 

We will use this session object later on. You will notice that we are using type protection through *typeof* to ensure that
we are only assigning strings to user.id, user.stripeCustomerId, and user.isPro.

<div className={styles.code}>

```
...

// https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/example
export default NextAuth({
  adapter: ...
  providers: ...
  callbacks: {
    // Adds userId, stripeCustomerId, and isPro boolean from DB to the default session values
    session: async ({ session, user }) => {
      if (typeof user.id === 'string') session.user.id = user.id;
      if (typeof user.stripeCustomerId === 'string') {
        session.user.stripeCustomerId = user.stripeCustomerId;
      }
      if (typeof user.isPro === 'boolean') session.user.isPro = user.isPro;
      return Promise.resolve(session);
    },
  },
})
```

</div>

Adding this callback will raise some Typescript errors as user.id, user.stripeCustomerId, and user.isPro are not typical
properties of the session object.

In order to fix these errors we need to add the custom types ourselves.

In the *types* folder create a file called *next-auth.d.ts* with the following code:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
import { DefaultUser } from 'next-auth';

declare module 'next-auth' {
  interface Session {
    user: DefaultUser & {
      id: string;
      stripeCustomerId: string;
      isPro: boolean;
    };
  }
}
```

</div>

### Add SessionProvider to application

The final step in setting up NextAuth.js is wrapping your components in a session provider. This allows the session object
to be passed across components which is required for the use of *useSession()*.

Adjust the *_app.tsx* file under the *pages* folder to match below:

<div className={styles.code}>

```
import "../styles/globals.css";
import type { AppProps } from "next/app";
import { SessionProvider } from "next-auth/react";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps: { session, ...pageProps } }: AppProps) {
  return (
    // Wrap in SessionProvider from NextJs. Allows session to be passed through components
    // https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#sessionprovider
    <SessionProvider session={session}>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </SessionProvider>
  );
}

export default MyApp;

```

</div>
<div id='test'></div>

## Test NextAuth.js flow

We should now have all the necessary setup for NextAuth.js complete. Below I have included code for two pages.

This first page is an unprotected page that includes a login button. It will replace the *index.tsx* page that was automatically generated for you.

<div className={styles.code}>

```
import type { NextPage } from "next";
import { signIn } from "next-auth/react";

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        // NextAuth function to initiate user authentication flow
        // https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signin
        signIn(undefined, { callbackUrl: "/dashboard" });
      }}
    >
      Login
    </button>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

</div>

This second page is a protected page called *dashboard.tsx* that only a registered user should be able to access.

<div className={styles.code}>

```
import { useSession, getSession } from "next-auth/react";
import { NextPage, NextPageContext } from "next";
import { signOut } from "next-auth/react";

const Dashboard: NextPage = () => {
  const { data: session } = useSession();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome {session?.user.name}</h1>
      <button
        onClick={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          // Nextauth function to initiate user signout flow
          // https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/client#signout
          signOut({ callbackUrl: "/" });
        }}
      >
        Logout
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Dashboard;

// Export the `session` prop to use sessions with Server Side Rendering
export async function getServerSideProps(context: NextPageContext) {
  const session = await getSession(context);

  if (!session) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: "/",
        permanent: false,
      },
    };
  }

  return {
    props: { session },
  };
}

```

</div>

Start up your development server by typing:

<div className={styles.code}>
npm run dev
</div>

You should see a page with a login button. When you click that button it should redirect to NextAuth.js' default sign-in page.

Select the Auth0 button and create an account if necessary. After loggin in you should see a page with a welcom message and
a logout button.

When you click the logout button it should return you to the first page with the login button.

If you attempt to directly access the protected page without logging in it will return you to the homepage.

Next we will set up Stripe and integrate it with NextAuth.js.
